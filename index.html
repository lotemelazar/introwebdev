        <b>Why i like the movie:</b>
        the first reason is the level of acting by the cast of this film,especially HeathLedger(Joker). <br /> The
        second
        reason is because the way that Christopher Nolan(Director and writer) tells us a fictional
        story like batman in the most realistic way that you can tell this kind of story.

        <b>Why i like to visit Barcelona:</b>
        <br>
        <li>Football Club Barcelona - As a football fan in general and specifically a fan of F.C.Barcelona it is a real
            pleasure for me to visit this city to see football match </li>
        <li>The Food:
            <ul>Paella</ul>
            <ul>Croquettes</ul>
            <ul>Patatas Bravas</ul>
            <ul>Jamon Iberico</ul>
            <ul> Potato Bombas</ul>

        </li>
        <li>The Famous Gaudi Architecture - Gaudi’s exuberant buildings are destinations in their own right. From the
            soaring Sagrada Familia, which dominates Barcelona’s skyline with its Gothic towers, to the quirky
            playground that is Park Guell, Gaudi’s architecture elevates the city and it would be a crime to miss it!
